# 📰 Fake News Prediction Using Machine Learning

Fake News Prediction is a Machine Learning project that uses NLP techniques and Logistic Regression to classify news articles as Real or Fake. The model is trained on labeled news data and can predict the authenticity of new articles through a Python-based prediction script.

## 📖 Overview

With the rapid spread of misinformation online, identifying fake news has become increasingly important. This project leverages NLP and Machine Learning to analyze news content and predict whether an article is genuine or fake.

## ✨ Features

* News authenticity prediction (Real/Fake)
* Text preprocessing using NLTK
* TF-IDF feature extraction
* Logistic Regression classifier
* Model evaluation with accuracy metrics
* Easy-to-use prediction script
* Modular project structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK
* Joblib
* TF-IDF Vectorizer
* Logistic Regression
